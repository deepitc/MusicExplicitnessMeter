# MusicExplicitnessMeter


The MusicExplicitnessMeter project is a program written in Scheme that allows users to input the name of any song and retrieve its lyrics from songlyrics.com. 
The program then uses a pre-defined list of explicit words to count the number of times those words appear in the song's lyrics. 
The program calculates the percentage of explicit words in the lyrics and displays the results using visuals, such as an explicitness bar. 
This allows users to easily determine the explicitness of a given song without having to manually read and analyze the lyrics.
